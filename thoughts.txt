- 'todos' will be objects, created using a factory function
- properties for todo items?
    1) title
    2) description
    3) dueDate
    4) priority
    5) notes (optional)
- different lists of todos called projects
  (include a 'default' project, so the inbox)


Things to think about:

1) Interface: 
 - Inbox
 - Sidebar with list of all Projects (open a project
and all associated tasks come up)
 - Filters (filter across all projects, filter on:
priority, dueDate, todos done and not done yet)

2) Have a project entity which has a list of todo items 
   Given the "id" of a task, change the todo as complete, priority etc 

Tasks:
- Create homepage (done)
- Create primitives (todos, projects) (done)
- Link project creation with the DOM (done)
- Functions to delete projects (done)
- Open a new "tab" for each project (done)
- Create a todo creation element (done)
- "Task can't be empty" bug (done)
- Add todos to every project (done)
- Make sure "tab switching" b/w projects (minus inbox) works flawlessly (done)
- Make buttons look prettier (done)
- Provision to delete todos (done)
- Make priorities work, color coding (done)

- Element to set todo as complete
- Provision to edit todos
- Make todos look prettier
- Debug the whole inbox concept
- What happens if we're on a project and delete it? 
- Filtering in the inbox
- Get today and next week tab to work
- Autocorrect 
- Predictive text (???)



- Brainstorm how to organize stuff
