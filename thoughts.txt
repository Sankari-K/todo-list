- 'todos' will be objects, created using a factory function
- properties for todo items?
    1) title
    2) description
    3) dueDate
    4) priority
- different lists of todos called projects
  (include a 'default' project, so the inbox)


Things to think about:

1) Interface: 
 - Inbox
 - Sidebar with list of all Projects (open a project
and all associated tasks come up)
 - Filters (filter across all projects, filter on:
priority, dueDate, todos done and not done yet)

2) Have a project entity which has a list of todo items 
   Given the "id" of a task, change the todo as complete, priority etc 

Tasks:
- Create homepage (done)
- Create primitives (todos, projects) (done)
- Link project creation with the DOM (done)
- Functions to delete projects (done)
- Open a new "tab" for each project (done)
- Create a todo creation element (done)
- "Task can't be empty" bug (done)
- Add todos to every project (done)
- Make sure "tab switching" b/w projects (minus inbox) works flawlessly (done)
- Make buttons look prettier (done)
- Provision to delete todos (done)
- Make priorities work, color coding (done)
- Element to set todo as complete (done)
- Provision to edit todos (done)
- Make sure updated todo values are valid (done)
- Provision to edit todos - test (done)
        1) deleting todo while editing (check)
        2) clicking on edit again (check)
        3) moving to a different tab (check)     
- Debug the whole inbox concept (done)
  (make sure are exit() functions are called, in case the user 
  switches to the inbox w/o cicking on cancel - look at the 
  projectPage file for reference)
        1) Initialize data structures with the default value (check)
        2) Show the proper default page (check)
  Remaining: testing (check)
- Bug in deleting a task in the inbox (done)
- What happens if we're on a project and delete it? Should redirect to inbox (done)
- Enhancement: redirect to inbox only when the user was on the deleted tab (done)
- Get today tab to work (done)
- Bug: When I click on edit in the today tab, the todo disappears (done)
  [there was an error in the checkDueToday function, I didn't find the todo object to
  find its due date property. once this was resolved, it had to be made sure that this
  function will execute only *after* the todo is edited. so instead of adding an event 
  listener for the edit button, I called the check() function in the edit todo function,
  provided that the user is on the today page.]
- Get next week tab to work (done)
- What happens when a todo is edited on the bext week tab? (done)
- Add a bottom margin for "today" and "this week" headers (done)
- Add a "nothing due" text if today / next week is empty (done)
- Add persistence for task status (whether it is done/not done) (done)

- Local storage
- Bug: when in the inbox tab, when someone deletes a project, those associated tasks still stay
- Dealing with expired/overdue todos (use a filter in inbox/ automatically change its color?)
- Filtering in the inbox
- Dark mode

- Brainstorm how to organize stuff
