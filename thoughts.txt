- 'todos' will be objects, created using a factory function
- properties for todo items?
    1) title
    2) description
    3) dueDate
    4) priority
    5) notes (optional)
- different lists of todos called projects
  (include a 'default' project, so the inbox)


Things to think about:

1) Interface: 
 - Inbox
 - Sidebar with list of all Projects (open a project
and all associated tasks come up)
 - Filters (filter across all projects, filter on:
priority, dueDate, todos done and not done yet)

2) Have a project entity which has a list of todo items 
   Given the "id" of a task, change the todo as complete, priority etc 

Tasks:
- Create homepage (done)
- Create primitives (todos, projects) (done)
- Link project creation with the DOM (done)
- Functions to delete projects (done)
- Open a new "tab" for each project 
- Add todos to every project
- Brainstorm how to organize stuff
